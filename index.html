    He was an unbelievable Cardinals player.

   <h1>Favorite Food</h1>
  <p>
 My favorite food is chocolate cake. I like chocolate cake for the following reasons:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>It tastes extremely good.</li>
  <li>It is fun to have at parties.</li>
  <li>You can write anything you want on it.</li>
</ul>
  <pre>
    With most foods, you cannot write anything on it. But with chocolate cake, you can. 
    This means that you can have chocolate cake for any occasion. 
  </pre>

<h1>My Favorite Fun Fact</h1>
  <p>
    My favorite fun fact is that mosquitos are deadliest animal on the planet.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.cnet.com/pictures/the-24-deadliest-animals-on-earth-ranked/24/">Mosquitos are responsible for more human deaths than humans every year</a>. 
    <br>
    Most of the deaths are cause by malaria, which is scary.
  </p>
    Trust me, you <b>DO NOT</b> want to be trapped in a room alone with one of these things.
