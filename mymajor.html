    <h1>My Major at Mizzou</h1>
      <p>
        I am enrolled as a Political Science/Economics Dual Degree Student.
        <br>
        Here I will focus on Political Science.
        <br>
        I really enjoy my Political Science classes. I feel like I learn so much in them.
        <br>
        My favorite Political Science classes so far have been:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>American Foreign Policy</li>
        <li>Power and Money</li>
        <li>Strategy and Warfare</li>
      </ol>
