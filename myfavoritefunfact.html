<h1>My Favorite Fun Fact</h1>
  <p>
    My favorite fun fact is that mosquitos are deadliest animal on the planet.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.cnet.com/pictures/the-24-deadliest-animals-on-earth-ranked/24/">Mosquitos are responsible for more human deaths than humans every year</a>.
    <br>
    Most of the deaths are cause by malaria, which is scary.
  </p>
    Trust me, you <b>DO NOT</b> want to be trapped in a room alone with one of these things.
